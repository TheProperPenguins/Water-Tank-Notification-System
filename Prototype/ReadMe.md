Prototype
==============
Our goal is to manufacture an arduino that can communicate water pressure levels to a computer.

<ul>
<li> arduino </li>
<li> water pressure sensor</li>
<li> LED </li>
<li> graduated cylinder</li>
<li> arduino button </li>
</ul>


<dt>Testing the Prototype</dt>
We tested our prototype by submerging the water pressure sensor into a graduated cylinder, we set the minimum pressure level by pressing a button, and set an LED to light up when the water pressure fell below this predetermined minimum.
