Automatic-Water-Tank-Filler
===========================
Backround/Client info

In the September of 2014, a small local farmer by the name of Andre Houssney presented to us some problems he was having on his farm.
One of the main problems he presented was the fact that he had to go check on the water levels of his animals everyday (sometimes even more than twice a day)
We decided to tackel this problem by creating a water tank filler that would automaticaly turn on the spicket and fill the amimals trough.


Design requirements:
-Had to be able to withstand elements (rain, snow, wind etc.)
-Had to be water proof (as so it wouldn't short circuit in a wet enviroment)
-Had to fit his spicket as well as be easily installed
-Had to be under a $375 buget (afforable for other farmers)
-Had to be universal
