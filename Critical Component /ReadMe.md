Critical Component
==================
We chose our critical componet to be the communication between the cell phone/arduino to our client.

To recap:
We are making a water notification system that is attached to a water pressure sensor that will alert our client about his water tanks being low.

<b>Overview of Process</b>

We chose to use a cell phone instead of the xbee's because we needed the system to be able to work if there was no wireless internet as well as be cost effient. The xbee's would not nessasaraly need internet, but in order to communicate over a long distance, we would need quite a few of them. Also, since we know our client has cell phone service on his farm, we felt this was the best way to go. We were able to use the phone by programming the Arduino with AT commands.

<b>Here is the AT command coding we used to tell the cell phone to send a message</b>
