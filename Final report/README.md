Final Report
==============
Our project was successful! The cell phone and arduino are hooked up to the solar panel so the actual project should last months on end without needing to be checked.
Andre, our client, saw our finished product during our Design Expo and was very impressed and happy that he would soon recive it for his water tank.

<p> <b> Automatic Water Tank Notification System </b> </p>
We created a system that notifies a user when the water levels in any given tank have fallen below the desirable level.  The user is notified via text message sent from an arduino attached to the water sensor.  Additionally there is a solar panel feature that prevents the system from running out of power.  This system allows our client to monitor his tank’s water levels without having to visit the tanks in person. All the farmer has to do is place the sensor at the bottom of his tank, fill the tank to the desired water level, press the button to program that value, put his phone number in the phone and then he’s done!

<p> <b> Analysis </b> </p>

<ul>
<li>Solar Panel Output: ~7mwh (optimal conditions)</li>
<li>Battery Output: 6V Maximum (800 mAh per battery) </li>
<li>Battery life expectancy of Arduino- 1 month of no charge from solar panel </li>
<li>Battery life expectancy of Cell phone- 4 days (not hooked up to the solar panel) </li>
<li>System works best if water in tank is not sloshing around when the water is at the level of the sensor </li>
</ul>

<p> <b> Timeline </b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Oct 9th- Introduction Presentation</li>
<li>Oct 17th- All materials collected/ half of prototype done </li>
<li>Oct 23rd- Water sensing part done (start working on final product with cell phone) </li>
<li>Oct 31st- Continue working on making final product and design review </li>
<li>Nov 6th- Critical design review </li>
<li>Nov 14th- Finishing touches on final product and testing </li>
<li>Nov 20th- Hardware Bazaar </li>
<li>Nov 28th- More testing and refine product/ work on presentation for Expo</li>
<li>Dec 6th-Design Expo</li>
<li>Dec 12th- Final Design Report</li>
</ul>

<p> <b> Future Work </b> </p>

<ul>
<li>Make it so only the SMS capability is attached to the Arduino (take away the LCD screen ect. To save on battery power)</li>
<li>Attach a key pad on the outside of the box so the user doesn't have to open the box to program their phone number</li>
<li>Make it so the programmable button is on the outside of box to make it more user friendly </li>
</ul>

<p> <b> Costs </b> </p>
![Budget](https://github.com/TheProperPenguins/Water-Tank-Notification-System/blob/master/Github%20Pictures/Screen%20Shot%202014-12-11%20at%202.28.38%20PM.jpg)
<dd> ~$210.00 </dd> 
<dd> This inluded the cost of our unused phones and unused items.</dd>
<dt> Fanufactoring Costs </dt>
<dd> $79.99 </dd>
<dd> If we were able to manufactor our product, with our own board, sensor, and a GMS sheild; we would sell it to the public for this price</dd>
